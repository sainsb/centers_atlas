Two TriMet bus lines provide transit access to the town center. A community plan for the larger Aloha-Reedville area calls for retaining the predominant residential character in the town center, while increasing density and locating the most intensive land use patterns at the intersection of Tualatin Valley Highway and 185th Avenue.

South of the railroad is the walkable older part of the city that is mostly residential and includes the library. The area along SW Canyon Road and SW Beaverton Hillsdale Highway, east of SW Lombard is composed mostly of large scale auto oriented commercial development. The resulting mix of commercial uses including shops and restaurants, make this regional center the commercial and retail hub for much of Beaverton and parts of unincorporated Washington County. The Beaverton Transit Center provides transit access via MAX Light Rail Red and Blue Lines, numerous TriMet bus lines and the northern terminus of the Westside Express Service Commuter Rail.",

While auto-oriented development is the predominant land use along the highway, there is a significant amount of single family residences in the town center along with civic uses such as the library and city offices. The center is served by one TriMet bus line that connects to Forest Grove and additional transit options in Hillsboro, including the terminus of the MAX Light Rail Blue Line. Local plans highlight the desire to concentrate retail, businesses and civic uses along Adair and Baseline Streets in order to make the area more of a community focused destination and less of a thoroughfare.",

Additionally it has transit access via five TriMet bus lines and MAX Light Rail Blue and Red lines, although the light rail station is separated from much of the housing and commercial development that is presently occurring in the center. This development is consistent with the community vision that the town center will include a mix of residential types and densities along with commercial and office uses.",

The area surrounding SW Main Street is compact and walkable with a mix of local commercial and residential uses. City Hall and other city department offices are located near this portion of the town center and Fanno Creek Park provides a significant ribbon of green through the downtown. The Tigard Triangle portion of the center mostly contains auto-oriented retail and other employment uses. Portland and Western Railroad tracks cut through the town center and provide rail spurs to the adjacent employment land. The center is served by the Westside Express Commuter Rail Service, seven TriMet bus lines, and the Fanno Creek Regional Trail. The town center is being studied for future high-capacity transit investments through the regional Southwest Corridor planning process.",
