     <h2 id="About2">About</a></h2>
     The State of the Centers report helps measure progress in creating the type of centers envisioned in the 2040 Growth Concept and to illustrate the kind of investments that contribute to a successful center.
     <h2 id="Where">Where we are today</a></h2>
      More than a decade ago, the region set a course to grow as a constellation of compact, vibrant communities that use land efficiently, maintain connections to the natural environment and promote strong local and regionaleconomies. The adoption in 1995 of the 2040 Growth Concept provided a guide to actively manage the growth of the region by encouraging development in centers and corridors and maintaining a tight urban growth boundary. By designating 38 centers across the Portland metropolitan area as a focus for redevelopment, transportation options and concentrations of housing and employment, the growth concept provides direction for achieving the desired outcomes for the region. It helps protect the farms, forestland and natural areas so critical to the quality of life residents of the region enjoy. Over the 15 years since the growth concept was adopted, local governments have developed aspirations for vibrant centers that reflect the vision of the residents, businesses and property owners. City and county governments have taken steps to create vibrant, safe and livable centers by amending their comprehensive plans, providing financial assistance and investing in essential public amenities to help spur private investment. The State of the Centers report is intended to help measure the region’s progress in creating the type of centers envisioned in the 2040 Growth Concept and reflected in local aspirations, and to illustrate the kind of investments that contribute to a successful center. The report reflects the relationship between people, employment, housing, businesses and built environment that makes each center unique. What emerges is an indication of the common elements in centers that contribute to meeting aspirations of local communities. In categorizing and examining these elements, the report serves as a “toolbox” to help communities evaluate progress in achieving their aspirations and to promote successful investments that move communities toward the desired regional outcomes reflected in the growth concept. 

      <h2 id="SOC2009">2009 State of the Centers report</a></h2>
      Two years ago, Metro published the first report on the state of the centers. The initial report provided a snapshot of land use and transportation conditions in centers to establish a framework for evaluating future development Where we are today The State of the Centers report helps measure progress in creating the type of centers envisioned in the 2040 Growth Concept and to illustrate the kind of investments that contribute to a successful center. 2011 State of the Centers 5 and investments. In doing so, it illustrated the wide variation in the level of development among centers. It was the first report to delineate each center and provide comparative statistics about them as well as tools to guide conversation about future development. The boundaries for centers reflect those adopted by local governments where available. For centers without adopted boundaries, the data reflects mixeduse residential and commercial areas for analysis purposes within the vicinity of the center on the 2040 Growth Concept map. The 2009 report displayed in graphic form different places along a spectrum of activity by illustrating the relationship between populations that live or work in a center and the number of urban amenities – a retail outlet or service that supports urban lifestyles and preferences – in each. The activity spectrum identified six districts within the Portland city limits that each represent a type of center, providing a reference point for local jurisdictions to use to guide their own aspirations for their center. 

      <h2 id="SOC2011">2011 State of the Centers report</a></h2>
      Although economic conditions have slowed both nationally and regionally in the past three years, the region continues to see incremental investments in its urban centers. In a time of limited funding, it has become increasingly important to target investments and leverage them with other public and private funding to be successful. Based on suggestions from local jurisdiction staff and other stakeholders, the second edition of the State of the Centers report includes additional measures to help communities understand how their centers are performing, including information on jobs, income and transportation use. New in this year’s report is the visual representation of seven characteristics of a successful center and the relative strength of each compared to the region. Another feature is the addition of comparative data for a one-mile buffer zone, measured from the center’s boundary. Not surprisingly, as communities evolve aspirations for centers change. The 2011 report reflects the change in 2010 of the Tanasbourne Town Center to a regional center, the addition of Cornelius Town Center and the relocation of the Happy Valley Town Center. 

      <h2 id="CIS">Community Investment Strategy</a></h2> 
      In 2010, the Metro Council adopted a Community Investment Strategy (Ordinance 10-1244B) that proposes a coordinated approach to target investments for the most effective use of public and private resources within each community in the context of broader regional needs. The 2011 edition of the State of the Centers report is intended to help identify investment needs by illustrating current conditions and providing a comparison for centers across the region. 
    
      <h2 id="Looking_Forward">Looking forward</h2> 
      Future editions of the State of the Centers report will be increasingly web-based, allowing the data to be updated regularly to better monitor the performance of a center in meeting desired outcomes for vibrant communities, jobs, transportation choices, greenhouse gas reduction and equity. New 2010 census data and other sources will continue to be reviewed and included, as relevant, while retaining key measures that will allow for comparisons over time. Metro is open to suggestions for improving the presentation of data or in defining new measures for evaluating performance.
