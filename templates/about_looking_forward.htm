      The State of the Centers report will continue to be web-based, allowing the data to be updated on a two-year cycle to better monitor the performance of a center in meeting desired regional and local outcomes. New census data and other sources will continue to be reviewed and included, as relevant, while retaining key measures that will allow for comparisons over time. Metro is open to suggestions for improving the presentation of data or in defining new measures for evaluating performance.
