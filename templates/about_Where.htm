      More than a decade ago, the region set a course to grow as a constellation of compact, vibrant communities that use land efficiently, maintain connections to the natural environment and promote strong local and regionaleconomies. The adoption in 1995 of the 2040 Growth Concept provided a guide to actively manage the growth of the region by encouraging development in centers and corridors and maintaining a tight urban growth boundary. By designating 38 centers across the Portland metropolitan area as a focus for redevelopment, transportation options and concentrations of housing and employment, the growth concept provides direction for achieving the desired outcomes for the region. It helps protect the farms, forestland and natural areas so critical to the quality of life residents of the region enjoy. Over the 15 years since the growth concept was adopted, local governments have developed aspirations for vibrant centers that reflect the vision of the residents, businesses and property owners. City and county governments have taken steps to create vibrant, safe and livable centers by amending their comprehensive plans, providing financial assistance and investing in essential public amenities to help spur private investment. The State of the Centers report is intended to help measure the region’s progress in creating the type of centers envisioned in the 2040 Growth Concept and reflected in local aspirations, and to illustrate the kind of investments that contribute to a successful center. The report reflects the relationship between people, employment, housing, businesses and built environment that makes each center unique. What emerges is an indication of the common elements in centers that contribute to meeting aspirations of local communities. In categorizing and examining these elements, the report serves as a “toolbox” to help communities evaluate progress in achieving their aspirations and to promote successful investments that move communities toward the desired regional outcomes reflected in the growth concept.
