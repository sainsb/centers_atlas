      <p>Two decades ago, the region set a course to grow as a constellation of compact, vibrant communities that use land efficiently, maintain connections to the natural environment and promote strong local and regional economies. Adopted in 1995, the 2040 Growth Concept provided a guide to actively manage the growth of the region by designating and encouraging development in centers and corridors and providing for targeted urban growth boundary expansions. The 38 designated centers in the Growth Concept became a focus for providing increased opportunities for concentrations of housing, services, employment uses and multi-modal transportation options. This type of concentrated and intentional growth helps protect the farms, forestland and natural areas so critical to the quality of life residents of the region enjoy. Over the 20 years since the growth concept was adopted, local governments have taken steps to create vibrant, safe and livable centers that reflect the vision of their residents, businesses and property owners.</p>
      <p>The State of the Centers report is intended to help measure the region’s progress in creating the type of centers envisioned in the 2040 Growth Concept and reflected in local aspirations, and to illustrate the kind of investments that contribute to a successful center. The report reflects the relationship between people, employment, housing, businesses and the built environment that makes each center unique. What emerges is an indication of the common elements in centers that contribute to creating vibrant and successful downtowns. In categorizing and examining these elements, the report serves as a “toolbox” to help communities evaluate progress in achieving their aspirations and to promote successful investments that move communities toward the desired regional outcomes reflected in the growth concept.</p>
      <p>This is the third installment of the State of the Centers Report.</p>
