      <h2 id="SOC2011">2011 State of the Centers report</a></h2>
      Although economic conditions have slowed both nationally and regionally in the past three years, the region continues to see incremental investments in its urban centers. In a time of limited funding, it has become increasingly important to target investments and leverage them with other public and private funding to be successful. Based on suggestions from local jurisdiction staff and other stakeholders, the second edition of the State of the Centers report includes additional measures to help communities understand how their centers are performing, including information on jobs, income and transportation use. New in this year’s report is the visual representation of seven characteristics of a successful center and the relative strength of each compared to the region. Another feature is the addition of comparative data for a one-mile buffer zone, measured from the center’s boundary. Not surprisingly, as communities evolve aspirations for centers change. The 2011 report reflects the change in 2010 of the Tanasbourne Town Center to a regional center, the addition of Cornelius Town Center and the relocation of the Happy Valley Town Center.
